CATEGORIES:Health
DESCRIPTION:The intestinal epithelium is a critical mucosal barrier that c
 onfines the gut microbiota to the lumen\, preventing these generally benef
 icial microbes from invading host tissues and triggering overt inflammatio
 n. While gut homeostasis requires this physical separation of the microbio
 ta and host\, it also depends on symbiotic interactions between them\, whi
 ch often occur through small molecule metabolites. For instance\, by conve
 rting indigestible fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)\, the microbi
 ota provides colonic epithelial cells with a fuel source to power fatty ac
 id oxidation (FAO) and energy production. Accordingly\, intestinal tissues
  from germ-free mice show signs of energy deprivation\, and the clinical s
 ignificance of this metabolic integration is evident from studies correlat
 ing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with impaired FAO and changes in micr
 obiota composition. However\, the mechanisms by which these alterations co
 uld contribute to IBD remain unclear\, highlighting the need to understand
  the pathways linking epithelial cell metabolism with microbial metabolism
  and whether disruptions in this symbiosis could promote inflammation. In 
 a recent study to investigate metabolic contributions from the microbiota 
 to the host\, we performed stable isotope tracing in a mouse model and fou
 nd that acetylated histones and numerous metabolites in epithelial cells c
 ontain microbiota-derived carbon. Treatment with DSS\, a chemical irritant
  that induces inflammation\, suppressed the isotopic labeling of molecules
  bearing fatty acid chains\, coinciding with shifts in microbiota composit
 ion and decreased expression of genes related to FAO. In ongoing work\, we
  are employing cell and organoid models to trace the anabolic and cataboli
 c pathways by which epithelial cells metabolize microbiota-derived carbon.
  Overall\, we aim to generate mechanistic insight into how metabolic inter
 actions between the gut microbiota and host promote tissue homeostasis and
  how a disruption in this sym\n\nEvent URL: https://videocast.nih.gov/watc

DESCRIPTION:This week's speakers in the Demystifying Medicine Series are J
 ohn Coffin\, Ph.D. (Tufts School of Medicine) and Carlos Del Rio\, M.D. (E
 mory School of Medicine). The theme of the complementary lectures is "The 
 Epidemic That Won't Quit: Unraveling the HIV Crisis". The Demystifying Med
 icine Series\, jointly sponsored by FAES and NIH\, includes presentations 
 on pathology\, diagnosis\, and therapy in the context of major disease pro
 blems and current research. Primarily directed toward PhD students\, clini
 cians and program managers\, this series is designed to help bridge the ga
 p between advances in biology and their application to major human disease
 s. Each session includes clinical and basic science components presented b
 y NIH staff and invitees. All students\, trainees\, fellows\, and staff ar
 e welcome to participate. Individuals who need reasonable accommodation to
  participate in this event should contact Ms. Diana Gomez at WALSoffice@od
