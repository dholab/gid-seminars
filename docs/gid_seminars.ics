DESCRIPTION:This month we will be joined by Dr. Gabi Fragiadakis from UCSF
  who will discuss the development and applications of the UCSF Data Librar
 y. The Data Library is a project that aims to capture\, curate\, and share
  biological data generated on campus — enabling data search\, exploratio
 n\, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applicati
 ons in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and
  completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University\, and joined t
 he faculty of the UCSF’s Department of Medicine\, Division of Rheumatolo
 gy in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Info
 rmatics Graduate Programs\, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative\, the Benioff Cen
 ter for Microbiome Medicine\, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences 
 Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the
  human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and
  data integration. \n\nAbout the Bay Area Open Science Group\nThe Bay Area
  Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and rese
 archers interested in incorporating open science into their research\, tea
 ching\, and learning. Targeting students\, faculty\, and staff at UCSF\, B
 erkeley\, and Stanford\, the goal of the community is to increase awarenes
 s of and engagement with all things open science\, including open access a
 rticles\, open research data\, open source software\, and open educational
  resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with 
 tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equita
 ble and reproducible.\n\nEvent URL: https://events.stanford.edu/event/ucsf

DESCRIPTION:Excess sugar intake is linked to numerous health problems\, in
 cluding weight gain\, obesity\, type 2 diabetes\, and heart disease. Too m
 uch added sugar can also contribute to high blood pressure\, and chronic i
 nflammation. Ah\, sugar… we know it's not good for us\, but we can't see
 m to stop eating it! In fact\, most Americans consume about 60 pounds of a
 dded sugar a year!\n\nJoin us for an interactive and practical webinar to 
 learn the biological\, psychological\, and social factors that make it so 
 hard to stop eating sugar. We will discuss the current guidelines from the
  American Heart Association about acceptable levels of added sugar for gen
 erally good health\, expose some surprising sources of added sugar\, and e
 xplore three specific strategies you can use to reduce your sugar consumpt
 ion. Walk away with a better understanding of why you crave sugar and 1-2 
 practical ways to eat less of it.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one
 -week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participant
 s. To receive incentive points\, attend at least 80% of the live session o
 r listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disability acco
 mmodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Sally Duplantier\, MS\, is a ge
 rontologist and healthspan educator\, dedicated to helping people “live 
 their best life longer.” She holds a master’s in gerontology from USC 
 and a certificate in nutrition science from Stanford and is currently purs
 uing a doctorate in public health. Her research examines how nutrition\, p
 hysical activity\, sleep\, stress\, and social engagement influence health
 y aging.\n\nClass details are subject to change.\n\nEvent URL: https://eve

DESCRIPTION:This event is part of Love Data Week at Stanford\, an annual f
 estival highlighting topics\, opportunities and services relevant to data 
 in research. \n\nJoin us in mapping a high-priority global health project\
 , helping organizations like Doctors without Borders and the Red Cross del
 iver vital aid to at-risk communities around the world. In just 20 minutes
 \, you'll join a movement of over 100K volunteers across the world using H
 umanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM). \n\nIn our Winter Mapathon\, we’ll b
 e using satellite imagery and simple online GIS tools to trace building ou
 tlines\, creating detailed digital maps of unmapped areas. Last spring\, w
 e mapped 2084 buildings in Malawi and hope to break that record! This Wint
 er\, we’ll be mapping a high-priority global health project that helps o
 rganizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross deliver vital\
 , life-saving aid. Through Missing Maps\, these efforts are sustained in c
 ollaboration with local communities\, ensuring long-term resilience in the
  regions we map.\n\nREGISTER HERE: https://luma.com/iekdb0rh\n\nOpen to al
 l Stanford affiliates in person or over Zoom & dinner will be provided!Non
 -Stanford affiliates may join us over Zoom! \nZoom: https://stanford.zoom.
 us/j/91622371366?pwd=ytaMaENiIgaR6rnR7HScVgPwA2NpRr.1&from=addon\n\nWhat i
 s a Mapathon? Accurate maps are essential for humanitarian responses and g
 lobal health—yet many communities remain unmapped. Missing Maps is a hum
 anitarian initiative started in 2014 to address this critical gap by mappi
 ng crucial infrastructure in underrepresented areas\, often through collab
 orative “Mapathon” events. The maps created help emergency responders 
 reach communities during natural disasters\, enable healthcare workers to 
 organize vaccination campaigns\, and support NGOs in developing resilient 
 infrastructure. \n\nSo\, join us for an evening of impact on Monday Februa
 ry 9th from 6-8 pm in Branner Earth Sciences Library. No prior experience 
 is necessary—mapping is easy to learn in just 20 min\n\nEvent URL: https

DESCRIPTION:Join the Tech Impact and Policy Center on February 10th from 1
 2PM–1PM Pacific for a seminar with Guilherme Lichand.\n\nStanford affili
 ates are invited to join us at 11:40 AM for lunch\, prior to the seminar. 
  The Winter Seminar Series continues through March\; see our Winter Semina
 r Series page for speakers and topics. Sign up for our newsletter for anno
 uncements. \n\nAbout the Seminar:\n\nA rapidly expanding literature docume
 nts the detrimental effects of excessive cell phone use\, particularly on 
 mental health outcomes and attention. While nearly all studies focus on ad
 ult populations\, many experts have used them to support phone bans in sch
 ools – partially in the hope that these might help reverse declining tre
 nds in standardized test scores dating from even before the Covid-19 pande
 mic. This paper provides first-hand evidence that phone restrictions in sc
 hools indeed causally boost K–12 learning outcomes. Leveraging the intro
 duction of a policy that banned non-pedagogical uses of cell phones within
  schools in Rio de Janeiro\, Brazil\, we contrast schools that already had
  strict rules on phone use even before the policy (the control group) to a
 ll other schools (the treatment group)\, before and after the ban. We find
  that\, 1.5 year after roll-out\, (1) the prevalence of high-usage schools
  converged across groups\; and (2) standardized test scores significantly 
 increased in treatment schools\, relative to control: in the former\, stud
 ents learned 0.06 s.d. more – enough to fully eliminate the baseline gap
  in test scores across groups.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nGuilherme is an As
 sistant Professor of Education at Stanford\, co-Director at the Stanford L
 emann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil\, a
 nd a faculty affiliate at the Stanford King Center for Global Development\
 , the Stanford Center on Early Childhood\, the Stanford Institute for Adva
 ncing Just Societies\, and the UC Berkeley Center for Effective Global Act

SUMMARY:Fighting Servants: Why Democratic Leaders Politicize Foreign Polic

DESCRIPTION:About the event: Why do democratic leaders politicize foreign 
 policy bureaucracies? While existing scholarship recognizes that leaders a
 nd bureaucrats often clash\, it usually attributes these conflicts to orga
 nizational pathologies\, principal-agent problems\, or policy disagreement
 s. This project develops a theory that explains when leaders attack their 
 foreign policy bureaucracies by installing loyalists\, marginalizing or pu
 rging careerists\, and creating parallel agencies\, a strategy I call poli
 ticization. It argues that leaders tend to politicize instead of bypassing
  or coordinating with the bureaucracy when two forces come together: when 
 leaders strongly distrust the bureaucracy\, fueled by intense partisan\, i
 deological\, and social conflicts\, and have enough domestic political pow
 er to reshape institutions in their own image.\n\nAbout the speaker: Emily
  Tallo is the India-U.S. security studies postdoctoral fellow at CISAC. Sh
 e received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago i
 n August 2025. Emily’s research centers on the domestic politics of fore
 ign policy\, focusing on how leaders\, bureaucracies\, and political parti
 es shape international politics with a regional emphasis on South Asia. Be
 fore academia\, Emily was a researcher at the Henry L. Stimson Center’s 
 South Asia program in Washington\, DC\, and an editor of the online magazi
 ne South Asian Voices. Her commentary has been featured in Foreign Policy\
 , The Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog\, and War on the Rocks.\n\nEven

DESCRIPTION:Title: Climate-resilient cities: science and solutions for glo
 bal urban heat stress\n\n \n\nAbstract: Extreme urban heat\, driven by cli
 mate change and rapid urbanization\, poses a growing threat to public heal
 th\, energy systems\, and economic productivity. Yet effective urban heat 
 mitigation is hindered by two key gaps: limited mechanistic understanding 
 of urban heat environment across global cities\, and a lack of robust tool
 s to assess the climate and economic tradeoffs of heat mitigation strategi
 es. \n\nMy research bridges these gaps by combining urban climate\, global
  climate modelling\, and econometric analysis to inform climate-resilient 
 urban planning. In this talk\, I first examine how urbanization reshapes s
 urface climate and humid heat stress across global cities\, highlighting a
 n overlooked humid heat risk in tropical cities where informal settlements
  lack access to cooling facilities. I then evaluate the climate and energy
  impacts of novel building materials under various background climates. Fi
 nally\, I extend these physical climate insights into policy-relevant outc
 omes by quantifying the economic costs of the urban heat island\, which su
 pports economically rational decision-making in heat interventions. \n\nTo
 gether\, my work provides a scientific and decision-making foundation for 
 designing effective and equitable heat mitigation strategies in a warming 
 world.\n\nKeer Zhang is a postdoctoral research associate in the High Mead
 ows Environmental Institute at Princeton University\, working with Profess
 or Elie Bou-Zeid. She received her Ph.D. in Environmental Studies from Yal
 e University in 2024 under the supervision of Professor Xuhui Lee\, and he
 r B.S. in Atmospheric Science from Sun Yat-sen University\, where she work
 ed with Professor Jian Hang. She has an interdisciplinary background in ur
 ban climate\, climate modelling\, and climate economics. Her research inve
 stigates the drivers and impacts of urban heat stress and evaluates eviden

DESCRIPTION:OverviewPediatricians play an important role in diagnosing you
 ng patients with asthma\, but it can be difficult to make the diagnosis in
  children younger than 5 years old. In this webinar\, participants will le
 arn an approach to asthma diagnosis in this age group. Since lung testing 
 is difficult\, the diagnosis is often based on identifying signs and sympt
 oms of reversible airflow obstruction and the documentation of response to
  asthma medication. The webinar will also discuss the indications for spec
 ialized care when the diagnosis of asthma is not straightforward or respon
 se to therapy is not successful. In addition\, pediatricians will learn ab
 out practical day-to-day management issues of patients with asthma and the
  types of treatments these patients may be receiving.\n\nRegistrationRegis

 ok signing to follow\nMerkin Auditorium\n \n\nLearn more and register at b
 road.io/MattKaplan.\n \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion
  people to defeating cancer and coping with climate change\, humanity face
 s some rather large challenges today. To tackle them\, we need science run
 ning like a well-oiled machine. Unfortunately\, it has more often resemble
 d a clunky old engine: loud\, temperamental\, and prone to breaking down a
 t the worst possible moment.\n \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding 
 cuts for science’s current woes\, but focusing only on money rather miss
 es the point. Many of science’s biggest problems have been around for ye
 ars\, sometimes centuries. Scientists have long been criticized\, sideline
 d\, or attacked for having ideas that were too new\, too inconvenient or s
 imply too correct for the people in power at the time. Even truly unscient
 ific behaviors\, like character assassination and fraud\, are not modern i
 nventions… though they do seem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance.\n \
 n\nThe good news is that longstanding problems are not the same as unsolva
 ble ones. Join Matt Kaplan\, science correspondent at The Economist and au
 thor of I Told You So! Scientists Who Were Ridiculed\, Exiled and Imprison
 ed… For Being Right\, for a spirited and insightful talk on the history 
 of these endemic issues and what we can do to finally consign them to the 
 scientific scrap heap.\n \n\nThis free talk is open to members of the gene

 Kaplan is a science correspondent at The Economist. He has written about e

DESCRIPTION:We spend one-third of our lives asleep and nearly as much time
  worrying about how much sleep we are getting - or not getting. Sleep is c
 ritical for the optimization or maintenance of nearly every aspect of huma
 n mental and physical health\, and inadequate sleep has been linked to dis
 ruptions in mood\, metabolism\, cognition\, heart function\, and immunity\
 , among others. Worrying about it makes it worse\, so finding the balance 
 is a crucial step in overall sleep health.\n\nJoin us for a noontime webin
 ar with a Stanford sleep expert to learn more about this vital process. Yo
 u will learn about the basic biology behind sleep\, common sleep problems\
 , the utility (or lack thereof) of wearables\, and ways to improve sleep. 
 Bring your questions and leave with a deeper understanding and practical t
 ools to help you get a better night’s sleep.\n\nThis class will be recor
 ded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registere
 d participants. To receive incentive points\, attend at least 80% of the l
 ive session or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request di
 sability accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Jamie Zeitzer\, Ph

DESCRIPTION:Did you know that fatigue\, muscle aches\, joint stiffness\, a
 nd weight gain or loss can be common symptoms of chronic inflammation? Whi
 le these symptoms can have many causes\, chronic low-level inflammation is
  increasingly recognized as one potential contributor.\n\nInflammation is 
 a vital part of the immune system's response to injury and infection. Howe
 ver\, when the inflammatory response goes on too long or shows up where it
 's not needed\, it can become problematic. This type of inflammation - cal
 led chronic low-level inflammation - has been linked to health conditions 
 including heart disease\, certain types of cancer\, cardio-respiratory dis
 ease\, diabetes\, and obesity.\n\nIn this engaging\, evidence-based webina
 r\, you will learn relevant research related to the causes of low-level ch
 ronic inflammation and how lifestyle choices such as nutrition\, movement\
 , sleep\, and reframing stress can protect us from this type of "inflammat
 ion gone awry." Walk away with an action plan of 1-2 changes you can make 
 in your daily life to minimize your risk of low-level chronic inflammation
  and improve your health and well-being.\n\nThis class will be recorded an
 d a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered part
 icipants. To receive incentive points\, attend at least 80% of the live se
 ssion or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disabili
 ty accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Sally Duplantier\, MS\, 
 is a gerontologist and healthspan educator\, dedicated to helping people 
 “live their best life longer.” She holds a master’s in gerontology f
 rom USC and a certificate in nutrition science from Stanford and is curren
 tly pursuing a doctorate in public health. Her research examines how nutri
 tion\, physical activity\, sleep\, stress\, and social engagement influenc
 e healthy aging.\n\nClass details are subject to change.\n\nEvent URL: htt
