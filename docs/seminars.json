      "description": "Excess sugar intake is linked to numerous health problems, including weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Too much added sugar can also contribute to high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation. Ah, sugar\u2026 we know it's not good for us, but we can't seem to stop eating it! In fact, most Americans consume about 60 pounds of added sugar a year!\n\nJoin us for an interactive and practical webinar to learn the biological, psychological, and social factors that make it so hard to stop eating sugar. We will discuss the current guidelines from the American Heart Association about acceptable levels of added sugar for generally good health, expose some surprising sources of added sugar, and explore three specific strategies you can use to reduce your sugar consumption. Walk away with a better understanding of why you crave sugar and 1-2 practical ways to eat less of it.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants. To receive incentive points, attend at least 80% of the live session or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disability accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Sally Duplantier, MS, is a gerontologist and healthspan educator, dedicated to helping people \u201clive their best life longer.\u201d She holds a master\u2019s in gerontology from USC and a certificate in nutrition science from Stanford and is currently pursuing a doctorate in public health. Her research examines how nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, and social engagement influence healthy aging.\n\nClass details are subject to change.",

      "description": "This event is part of Love Data Week at Stanford, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. \n\nJoin us in mapping a high-priority global health project, helping organizations like Doctors without Borders and the Red Cross deliver vital aid to at-risk communities around the world. In just 20 minutes, you'll join a movement of over 100K volunteers across the world using Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM). \n\nIn our Winter Mapathon, we\u2019ll be using satellite imagery and simple online GIS tools to trace building outlines, creating detailed digital maps of unmapped areas. Last spring, we mapped 2084 buildings in Malawi and hope to break that record! This Winter, we\u2019ll be mapping a high-priority global health project that helps organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross deliver vital, life-saving aid. Through Missing Maps, these efforts are sustained in collaboration with local communities, ensuring long-term resilience in the regions we map.\n\nREGISTER HERE: https://luma.com/iekdb0rh\n\nOpen to all Stanford affiliates in person or over Zoom & dinner will be provided!Non-Stanford affiliates may join us over Zoom! \nZoom: https://stanford.zoom.us/j/91622371366?pwd=ytaMaENiIgaR6rnR7HScVgPwA2NpRr.1&from=addon\n\nWhat is a Mapathon? Accurate maps are essential for humanitarian responses and global health\u2014yet many communities remain unmapped. Missing Maps is a humanitarian initiative started in 2014 to address this critical gap by mapping crucial infrastructure in underrepresented areas, often through collaborative \u201cMapathon\u201d events. The maps created help emergency responders reach communities during natural disasters, enable healthcare workers to organize vaccination campaigns, and support NGOs in developing resilient infrastructure. \n\nSo, join us for an evening of impact on Monday February 9th from 6-8 pm in Branner Earth Sciences Library.

      "description": "Join the Tech Impact and Policy Center on February 10th from 12PM\u20131PM Pacific for a seminar with Guilherme Lichand.\n\nStanford affiliates are invited to join us at 11:40 AM for lunch, prior to the seminar.  The Winter Seminar Series continues through March; see our Winter Seminar Series page for speakers and topics. Sign up for our newsletter for announcements. \n\nAbout the Seminar:\n\nA rapidly expanding literature documents the detrimental effects of excessive cell phone use, particularly on mental health outcomes and attention. While nearly all studies focus on adult populations, many experts have used them to support phone bans in schools \u2013 partially in the hope that these might help reverse declining trends in standardized test scores dating from even before the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper provides first-hand evidence that phone restrictions in schools indeed causally boost K\u201312 learning outcomes. Leveraging the introduction of a policy that banned non-pedagogical uses of cell phones within schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we contrast schools that already had strict rules on phone use even before the policy (the control group) to all other schools (the treatment group), before and after the ban. We find that, 1.5 year after roll-out, (1) the prevalence of high-usage schools converged across groups; and (2) standardized test scores significantly increased in treatment schools, relative to control: in the former, students learned 0.06 s.d. more \u2013 enough to fully eliminate the baseline gap in test scores across groups.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nGuilherme is an Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford, co-Director at the Stanford Lemann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil, and a faculty affiliate at the Stanford King Center for Global Development, the Stanford Center on Early Childhood, the Stanford Institute for Advancing Just Societies, and the UC Berkeley Center for Effective Global Action.

      "title": "Fighting Servants: Why Democratic Leaders Politicize Foreign Policy Bureaucracies",
      "description": "About the event: Why do democratic leaders politicize foreign policy bureaucracies? While existing scholarship recognizes that leaders and bureaucrats often clash, it usually attributes these conflicts to organizational pathologies, principal-agent problems, or policy disagreements. This project develops a theory that explains when leaders attack their foreign policy bureaucracies by installing loyalists, marginalizing or purging careerists, and creating parallel agencies, a strategy I call politicization. It argues that leaders tend to politicize instead of bypassing or coordinating with the bureaucracy when two forces come together: when leaders strongly distrust the bureaucracy, fueled by intense partisan, ideological, and social conflicts, and have enough domestic political power to reshape institutions in their own image.\n\nAbout the speaker: Emily Tallo is the India-U.S. security studies postdoctoral fellow at CISAC. She received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago in August 2025. Emily\u2019s research centers on the domestic politics of foreign policy, focusing on how leaders, bureaucracies, and political parties shape international politics with a regional emphasis on South Asia. Before academia, Emily was a researcher at the Henry L. Stimson Center\u2019s South Asia program in Washington, DC, and an editor of the online magazine South Asian Voices. Her commentary has been featured in Foreign Policy, The Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog, and War on the Rocks.",

      "description": "Title: Climate-resilient cities: science and solutions for global urban heat stress\n\n \n\nAbstract: Extreme urban heat, driven by climate change and rapid urbanization, poses a growing threat to public health, energy systems, and economic productivity. Yet effective urban heat mitigation is hindered by two key gaps: limited mechanistic understanding of urban heat environment across global cities, and a lack of robust tools to assess the climate and economic tradeoffs of heat mitigation strategies. \n\nMy research bridges these gaps by combining urban climate, global climate modelling, and econometric analysis to inform climate-resilient urban planning. In this talk, I first examine how urbanization reshapes surface climate and humid heat stress across global cities, highlighting an overlooked humid heat risk in tropical cities where informal settlements lack access to cooling facilities. I then evaluate the climate and energy impacts of novel building materials under various background climates. Finally, I extend these physical climate insights into policy-relevant outcomes by quantifying the economic costs of the urban heat island, which supports economically rational decision-making in heat interventions. \n\nTogether, my work provides a scientific and decision-making foundation for designing effective and equitable heat mitigation strategies in a warming world.\n\nKeer Zhang is a postdoctoral research associate in the High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University, working with Professor Elie Bou-Zeid.

In this webinar, participants will learn an approach to asthma diagnosis in this age group. Since lung testing is difficult, the diagnosis is often based on identifying signs and symptoms of reversible airflow obstruction and the documentation of response to asthma medication. The webinar will also discuss the indications for specialized care when the diagnosis of asthma is not straightforward or response to therapy is not successful. In addition, pediatricians will learn about practical day-to-day management issues of patients with asthma and the types of treatments these patients may be receiving.\n\nRegistrationRegistration for all practitioners - free\n\nTo register for this activity, please click HERE.\n\nCreditsAMA PRA Category 1 Credits\u2122 (1.00 hours), AAPA Category 1 CME credits (1.00 hours), ANCC Contact Hours (1.00 hours), Non-Physician Participation Credit (1.00 hours)\n\nTarget AudienceSpecialties - Family Medicine & Community Health, PediatricsProfessions - Advance Practice Nurse (APN), Fellow/Resident, Nurse, Physician, Physician Associate, Registered Nurse (RN) ObjectivesAt the conclusion of this activity, learners should be able to:\n1.

      "description": "Part of the Feminism in Theory and Practice Series.\n\nSex and Dissent: Stories of Feminist Resistance in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Spain offers four electrifying and hopeful accounts of feminist uprising that have swept through Latin America and Spain in the wake of #MeToo\u2014and what we can learn from these protest cultures in a fraught moment for democracy in the U.S.\n\nAs women\u2019s rights have faced alarming rollbacks in the United States over the past decade, mass feminist movements beyond our borders have achieved historic victories. Award-winning journalist Meaghan Beatley takes us to the frontlines to tell inspiring stories of resistance and political imagination that will be a vital roadmap in the years to come. A national reckoning over abortion in Argentina; a constitutional rewrite confronting structural inequality in Chile; a high-profile sexual assault case in Spain that sparked wide debate about consent; and in Mexico, student protesters forcing a national spotlight on the epidemic of femicide. \n\nThe product of a decade of immersive reporting, Beatley captures the urgency and creativity of these movements and the women who led a motley crew of former guerrilla fighters, student occupiers, and mothers standing down narco violence. \n\nOrganized by Writer in Residence Moira Donegan, the Feminism in Theory and Practice series welcomes contemporary creators, writers, scholars, and activists whose work challenges gender inequality in urgent and innovative ways.\n\nRSVP for this online event\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nMeaghan Beatley is a French and U.S. journalist covering feminist movements across Latin America and Spain. Her reporting has appeared in Time, The Guardian, The Atlantic, The Nation, and Foreign Policy. Formerly an editor in Chile and Argentina, she has reported from seven countries and won the One World Media Award for Best Feature.

To tackle them, we need science running like a well-oiled machine. Unfortunately, it has more often resembled a clunky old engine: loud, temperamental, and prone to breaking down at the worst possible moment.\n \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for science\u2019s current woes, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many of science\u2019s biggest problems have been around for years, sometimes centuries. Scientists have long been criticized, sidelined, or attacked for having ideas that were too new, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors, like character assassination and fraud, are not modern inventions\u2026 though they do seem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance.\n \n\nThe good news is that longstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan, science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scientists Who Were Ridiculed, Exiled and Imprisoned\u2026 For Being Right, for a spirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.\n \n\nThis free talk is open to members of the general public as well as the Broad community.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMatt Kaplan is a science correspondent at The Economist. He has written about everything from paleontology and parasites to virology and viticulture over the course of two decades. His writing has also appeared in National Geographic, New Scientist, Nature, and the New York Times.

Sleep is critical for the optimization or maintenance of nearly every aspect of human mental and physical health, and inadequate sleep has been linked to disruptions in mood, metabolism, cognition, heart function, and immunity, among others. Worrying about it makes it worse, so finding the balance is a crucial step in overall sleep health.\n\nJoin us for a noontime webinar with a Stanford sleep expert to learn more about this vital process. You will learn about the basic biology behind sleep, common sleep problems, the utility (or lack thereof) of wearables, and ways to improve sleep. Bring your questions and leave with a deeper understanding and practical tools to help you get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants.

      "description": "Did you know that fatigue, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and weight gain or loss can be common symptoms of chronic inflammation? While these symptoms can have many causes, chronic low-level inflammation is increasingly recognized as one potential contributor.\n\nInflammation is a vital part of the immune system's response to injury and infection. However, when the inflammatory response goes on too long or shows up where it's not needed, it can become problematic. This type of inflammation - called chronic low-level inflammation - has been linked to health conditions including heart disease, certain types of cancer, cardio-respiratory disease, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nIn this engaging, evidence-based webinar, you will learn relevant research related to the causes of low-level chronic inflammation and how lifestyle choices such as nutrition, movement, sleep, and reframing stress can protect us from this type of \"inflammation gone awry.\" Walk away with an action plan of 1-2 changes you can make in your daily life to minimize your risk of low-level chronic inflammation and improve your health and well-being.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants.
