The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus \u2014 enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF\u2019s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration. \n\nAbout the Bay Area Open Science Group\nThe Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible.",

Too much added sugar can also contribute to high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation. Ah, sugar\u2026 we know it's not good for us, but we can't seem to stop eating it! In fact, most Americans consume about 60 pounds of added sugar a year!\n\nJoin us for an interactive and practical webinar to learn the biological, psychological, and social factors that make it so hard to stop eating sugar. We will discuss the current guidelines from the American Heart Association about acceptable levels of added sugar for generally good health, expose some surprising sources of added sugar, and explore three specific strategies you can use to reduce your sugar consumption. Walk away with a better understanding of why you crave sugar and 1-2 practical ways to eat less of it.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants. To receive incentive points, attend at least 80% of the live session or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disability accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Sally Duplantier, MS, is a gerontologist and healthspan educator, dedicated to helping people \u201clive their best life longer.\u201d She holds a master\u2019s in gerontology from USC and a certificate in nutrition science from Stanford and is currently pursuing a doctorate in public health. Her research examines how nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, and social engagement influence healthy aging.\n\nClass details are subject to change.",

In just 20 minutes, you'll join a movement of over 100K volunteers across the world using Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM). \n\nIn our Winter Mapathon, we\u2019ll be using satellite imagery and simple online GIS tools to trace building outlines, creating detailed digital maps of unmapped areas. Last spring, we mapped 2084 buildings in Malawi and hope to break that record! This Winter, we\u2019ll be mapping a high-priority global health project that helps organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross deliver vital, life-saving aid. Through Missing Maps, these efforts are sustained in collaboration with local communities, ensuring long-term resilience in the regions we map.\n\nREGISTER HERE: https://luma.com/iekdb0rh\n\nOpen to all Stanford affiliates in person or over Zoom & dinner will be provided!Non-Stanford affiliates may join us over Zoom! \nZoom: https://stanford.zoom.us/j/91622371366?pwd=ytaMaENiIgaR6rnR7HScVgPwA2NpRr.1&from=addon\n\nWhat is a Mapathon? Accurate maps are essential for humanitarian responses and global health\u2014yet many communities remain unmapped. Missing Maps is a humanitarian initiative started in 2014 to address this critical gap by mapping crucial infrastructure in underrepresented areas, often through collaborative \u201cMapathon\u201d events. The maps created help emergency responders reach communities during natural disasters, enable healthcare workers to organize vaccination campaigns, and support NGOs in developing resilient infrastructure. \n\nSo, join us for an evening of impact on Monday February 9th from 6-8 pm in Branner Earth Sciences Library. No prior experience is necessary\u2014mapping is easy to learn in just 20 min",

      "description": "Join the Tech Impact and Policy Center on February 10th from 12PM\u20131PM Pacific for a seminar with Guilherme Lichand.\n\nStanford affiliates are invited to join us at 11:40 AM for lunch, prior to the seminar.  The Winter Seminar Series continues through March; see our Winter Seminar Series page for speakers and topics. Sign up for our newsletter for announcements. \n\nAbout the Seminar:\n\nA rapidly expanding literature documents the detrimental effects of excessive cell phone use, particularly on mental health outcomes and attention. While nearly all studies focus on adult populations, many experts have used them to support phone bans in schools \u2013 partially in the hope that these might help reverse declining trends in standardized test scores dating from even before the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper provides first-hand evidence that phone restrictions in schools indeed causally boost K\u201312 learning outcomes. Leveraging the introduction of a policy that banned non-pedagogical uses of cell phones within schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we contrast schools that already had strict rules on phone use even before the policy (the control group) to all other schools (the treatment group), before and after the ban. We find that, 1.5 year after roll-out, (1) the prevalence of high-usage schools converged across groups; and (2) standardized test scores significantly increased in treatment schools, relative to control: in the former, students learned 0.06 s.d. more \u2013 enough to fully eliminate the baseline gap in test scores across groups.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nGuilherme is an Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford, co-Director at the Stanford Lemann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil, and a faculty affiliate at the Stanford King Center for Global Development, the Stanford Center on Early Childhood, the Stanford Institute for Advancing Just Societies, and the UC Berkeley Center for Effective Global Action.

      "title": "Fighting Servants: Why Democratic Leaders Politicize Foreign Policy Bureaucracies",
      "description": "About the event: Why do democratic leaders politicize foreign policy bureaucracies? While existing scholarship recognizes that leaders and bureaucrats often clash, it usually attributes these conflicts to organizational pathologies, principal-agent problems, or policy disagreements. This project develops a theory that explains when leaders attack their foreign policy bureaucracies by installing loyalists, marginalizing or purging careerists, and creating parallel agencies, a strategy I call politicization. It argues that leaders tend to politicize instead of bypassing or coordinating with the bureaucracy when two forces come together: when leaders strongly distrust the bureaucracy, fueled by intense partisan, ideological, and social conflicts, and have enough domestic political power to reshape institutions in their own image.\n\nAbout the speaker: Emily Tallo is the India-U.S. security studies postdoctoral fellow at CISAC. She received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago in August 2025. Emily\u2019s research centers on the domestic politics of foreign policy, focusing on how leaders, bureaucracies, and political parties shape international politics with a regional emphasis on South Asia. Before academia, Emily was a researcher at the Henry L. Stimson Center\u2019s South Asia program in Washington, DC, and an editor of the online magazine South Asian Voices. Her commentary has been featured in Foreign Policy, The Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog, and War on the Rocks.",

Working closely with a team of researchers in Uganda, their group evaluates antimalarial resistance in Plasmodium falciparum collected from sites across Uganda. Using molecular and ex vivo approaches, they surveil for emerging or spreading drug resistance, evaluate novel markers of resistance, and seek to better understand mechanisms of resistance. In addition, they perform membrane feeding assays in which mosquitoes are fed malaria-infected blood with the goal of better understanding the human infectious reservoir of malaria and which populations can be targeted to best reduce ongoing malaria transmission.",

Yet effective urban heat mitigation is hindered by two key gaps: limited mechanistic understanding of urban heat environment across global cities, and a lack of robust tools to assess the climate and economic tradeoffs of heat mitigation strategies. \n\nMy research bridges these gaps by combining urban climate, global climate modelling, and econometric analysis to inform climate-resilient urban planning. In this talk, I first examine how urbanization reshapes surface climate and humid heat stress across global cities, highlighting an overlooked humid heat risk in tropical cities where informal settlements lack access to cooling facilities. I then evaluate the climate and energy impacts of novel building materials under various background climates. Finally, I extend these physical climate insights into policy-relevant outcomes by quantifying the economic costs of the urban heat island, which supports economically rational decision-making in heat interventions. \n\nTogether, my work provides a scientific and decision-making foundation for designing effective and equitable heat mitigation strategies in a warming world.\n\nKeer Zhang is a postdoctoral research associate in the High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University, working with Professor Elie Bou-Zeid.

In this webinar, participants will learn an approach to asthma diagnosis in this age group. Since lung testing is difficult, the diagnosis is often based on identifying signs and symptoms of reversible airflow obstruction and the documentation of response to asthma medication. The webinar will also discuss the indications for specialized care when the diagnosis of asthma is not straightforward or response to therapy is not successful. In addition, pediatricians will learn about practical day-to-day management issues of patients with asthma and the types of treatments these patients may be receiving.\n\nRegistrationRegistration for all practitioners - free\n\nTo register for this activity, please click HERE.\n\nCreditsAMA PRA Category 1 Credits\u2122 (1.00 hours), AAPA Category 1 CME credits (1.00 hours), ANCC Contact Hours (1.00 hours), Non-Physician Participation Credit (1.00 hours)\n\nTarget AudienceSpecialties - Family Medicine & Community Health, PediatricsProfessions - Advance Practice Nurse (APN), Fellow/Resident, Nurse, Physician, Physician Associate, Registered Nurse (RN) ObjectivesAt the conclusion of this activity, learners should be able to:\n1.

      "description": "Erol Fikrig, MD, is chief of Infectious Diseases and specializes in treating patients with vector-borne diseases including Dengue fever, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, and malaria. Vector-borne diseases are caused by infections transmitted to humans and other animals by mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and other blood-feeding invertebrates. Dr. Fikrig\u2019s research focuses on understanding Lyme disease, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (a rare infectious disease), malaria, and flaviviruses (vector-borne viruses that can cause a variety of diseases including hepatitis, encephalitis, and congenital abnormalities). He is interested in molecular approaches to prevent ticks and mosquitoes from feeding on mammalian hosts. For example, he and his team are developing a Lyme disease vaccine that uses mRNA technology to target deer ticks, which transmit the disease. Dr. Fikrig hopes to use this strategy to fight other illnesses, such as babesiosis, dengue, and malaria. Dr. Fikrig has received numerous awards, including the National Foundation of Infectious Disease Young Investigator Award, Infectious Disease Society of America Vaccine Development Award, American Heart Association Young Investigator Award, Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, and the Burroughs Wellcome Clinical Scientist Award in Translational Research. He was also a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

      "description": "Wednesday, March 11, 2026\n6:00 - 7:00 pm | Reception and book signing to follow\nMerkin Auditorium\n \n\nLearn more and register at broad.io/MattKaplan.\n \n\nFrom the energy crisis and feeding eight billion people to defeating cancer and coping with climate change, humanity faces some rather large challenges today. To tackle them, we need science running like a well-oiled machine. Unfortunately, it has more often resembled a clunky old engine: loud, temperamental, and prone to breaking down at the worst possible moment.\n \n\nIt is tempting to blame recent funding cuts for science\u2019s current woes, but focusing only on money rather misses the point. Many of science\u2019s biggest problems have been around for years, sometimes centuries. Scientists have long been criticized, sidelined, or attacked for having ideas that were too new, too inconvenient or simply too correct for the people in power at the time. Even truly unscientific behaviors, like character assassination and fraud, are not modern inventions\u2026 though they do seem to have enjoyed a recent renaissance.\n \n\nThe good news is that longstanding problems are not the same as unsolvable ones. Join Matt Kaplan, science correspondent at The Economist and author of I Told You So! Scientists Who Were Ridiculed, Exiled and Imprisoned\u2026 For Being Right, for a spirited and insightful talk on the history of these endemic issues and what we can do to finally consign them to the scientific scrap heap.\n \n\nThis free talk is open to members of the general public as well as the Broad community.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMatt Kaplan is a science correspondent at The Economist. He has written about everything from paleontology and parasites to virology and viticulture over the course of two decades. His writing has also appeared in National Geographic, New Scientist, Nature, and the New York Times. He is the author of The Science of Monsters and Science of the Magical, and co-author of David Attenborough\u2019s First Life: A Journey Through Time. He compl",

      "description": "Dan Olson is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics-Infectious Diseases. His research interests are focused on how to measure the effectiveness of vaccines and other health interventions against emerging infectious diseases. This includes how to detect disease in a population using innovative surveillance tools (i.e., smartphones, crowd-sourcing), studying the true burden of disease (both the health and socioeconomic impacts on the individual and the family), and how to reduce disease burden through cost-effective interventions such as vaccines. Much of this work takes place at his University of Colorado research site in Guatemala.",

      "title": "Unlock Better Sleep",
      "description": "We spend one-third of our lives asleep and nearly as much time worrying about how much sleep we are getting - or not getting. Sleep is critical for the optimization or maintenance of nearly every aspect of human mental and physical health, and inadequate sleep has been linked to disruptions in mood, metabolism, cognition, heart function, and immunity, among others. Worrying about it makes it worse, so finding the balance is a crucial step in overall sleep health.\n\nJoin us for a noontime webinar with a Stanford sleep expert to learn more about this vital process. You will learn about the basic biology behind sleep, common sleep problems, the utility (or lack thereof) of wearables, and ways to improve sleep. Bring your questions and leave with a deeper understanding and practical tools to help you get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants. To receive incentive points, attend at least 80% of the live session or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disability accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, is a professor in psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Stanford University and co-director of the Stanford Center for Sleep and Circadian Science, with more than 25 years of experience in sleep and circadian research.\n\nClass details are subject to change.",
