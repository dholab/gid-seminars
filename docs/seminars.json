The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus \u2014 enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF\u2019s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration. \n\nAbout the Bay Area Open Science Group\nThe Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible.",

Too much added sugar can also contribute to high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation. Ah, sugar\u2026 we know it's not good for us, but we can't seem to stop eating it! In fact, most Americans consume about 60 pounds of added sugar a year!\n\nJoin us for an interactive and practical webinar to learn the biological, psychological, and social factors that make it so hard to stop eating sugar. We will discuss the current guidelines from the American Heart Association about acceptable levels of added sugar for generally good health, expose some surprising sources of added sugar, and explore three specific strategies you can use to reduce your sugar consumption. Walk away with a better understanding of why you crave sugar and 1-2 practical ways to eat less of it.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants. To receive incentive points, attend at least 80% of the live session or listen to the entire recording within one week.  Request disability accommodations and access info.\n\nInstructor: Sally Duplantier, MS, is a gerontologist and healthspan educator, dedicated to helping people \u201clive their best life longer.\u201d She holds a master\u2019s in gerontology from USC and a certificate in nutrition science from Stanford and is currently pursuing a doctorate in public health. Her research examines how nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, and social engagement influence healthy aging.\n\nClass details are subject to change.",

      "description": "Join the Tech Impact and Policy Center on February 10th from 12PM\u20131PM Pacific for a seminar with Guilherme Lichand.\n\nStanford affiliates are invited to join us at 11:40 AM for lunch, prior to the seminar.  The Winter Seminar Series continues through March; see our Winter Seminar Series page for speakers and topics. Sign up for our newsletter for announcements. \n\nAbout the Seminar:\n\nA rapidly expanding literature documents the detrimental effects of excessive cell phone use, particularly on mental health outcomes and attention. While nearly all studies focus on adult populations, many experts have used them to support phone bans in schools \u2013 partially in the hope that these might help reverse declining trends in standardized test scores dating from even before the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper provides first-hand evidence that phone restrictions in schools indeed causally boost K\u201312 learning outcomes. Leveraging the introduction of a policy that banned non-pedagogical uses of cell phones within schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we contrast schools that already had strict rules on phone use even before the policy (the control group) to all other schools (the treatment group), before and after the ban. We find that, 1.5 year after roll-out, (1) the prevalence of high-usage schools converged across groups; and (2) standardized test scores significantly increased in treatment schools, relative to control: in the former, students learned 0.06 s.d. more \u2013 enough to fully eliminate the baseline gap in test scores across groups.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nGuilherme is an Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford, co-Director at the Stanford Lemann Center for Entrepreneurship and Educational Innovation in Brazil, and a faculty affiliate at the Stanford King Center for Global Development, the Stanford Center on Early Childhood, the Stanford Institute for Advancing Just Societies, and the UC Berkeley Center for Effective Global Action.

      "title": "Fighting Servants: Why Democratic Leaders Politicize Foreign Policy Bureaucracies",
      "description": "About the event: Why do democratic leaders politicize foreign policy bureaucracies? While existing scholarship recognizes that leaders and bureaucrats often clash, it usually attributes these conflicts to organizational pathologies, principal-agent problems, or policy disagreements. This project develops a theory that explains when leaders attack their foreign policy bureaucracies by installing loyalists, marginalizing or purging careerists, and creating parallel agencies, a strategy I call politicization. It argues that leaders tend to politicize instead of bypassing or coordinating with the bureaucracy when two forces come together: when leaders strongly distrust the bureaucracy, fueled by intense partisan, ideological, and social conflicts, and have enough domestic political power to reshape institutions in their own image.\n\nAbout the speaker: Emily Tallo is the India-U.S. security studies postdoctoral fellow at CISAC. She received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago in August 2025. Emily\u2019s research centers on the domestic politics of foreign policy, focusing on how leaders, bureaucracies, and political parties shape international politics with a regional emphasis on South Asia. Before academia, Emily was a researcher at the Henry L. Stimson Center\u2019s South Asia program in Washington, DC, and an editor of the online magazine South Asian Voices. Her commentary has been featured in Foreign Policy, The Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog, and War on the Rocks.",

Using molecular and ex vivo approaches, they surveil for emerging or spreading drug resistance, evaluate novel markers of resistance, and seek to better understand mechanisms of resistance. In addition, they perform membrane feeding assays in which mosquitoes are fed malaria-infected blood with the goal of better understanding the human infectious reservoir of malaria and which populations can be targeted to best reduce ongoing malaria transmission.",

      "description": "OverviewPediatricians play an important role in diagnosing young patients with asthma, but it can be difficult to make the diagnosis in children younger than 5 years old. In this webinar, participants will learn an approach to asthma diagnosis in this age group. Since lung testing is difficult, the diagnosis is often based on identifying signs and symptoms of reversible airflow obstruction and the documentation of response to asthma medication. The webinar will also discuss the indications for specialized care when the diagnosis of asthma is not straightforward or response to therapy is not successful. In addition, pediatricians will learn about practical day-to-day management issues of patients with asthma and the types of treatments these patients may be receiving.\n\nRegistrationRegistration for all practitioners - free\n\nTo register for this activity, please click HERE.\n\nCreditsAMA PRA Category 1 Credits\u2122 (1.00 hours), AAPA Category 1 CME credits (1.00 hours), ANCC Contact Hours (1.00 hours), Non-Physician Participation Credit (1.00 hours)\n\nTarget AudienceSpecialties - Family Medicine & Community Health, PediatricsProfessions - Advance Practice Nurse (APN), Fellow/Resident, Nurse, Physician, Physician Associate, Registered Nurse (RN) ObjectivesAt the conclusion of this activity, learners should be able to:\n1.

In addition, parallel collection of clinical isolates is underway with the idea of identifying genomic microbial determinants of outcomes in this population of patients. The primary goal of VENOUS is to address critical knowledge gaps regarding the clinical and microbial factors that determine the outcomes of VRE bacteremia and the most effective therapeutic approaches for managing these multidrug-resistant organisms.",
