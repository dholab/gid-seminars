      "title": "NIH ProtIG seminar by Peder Lund: Fatty acid metabolism as a symbiotic link between the gut microbiota and host epithelial cells",
      "description": "The intestinal epithelium is a critical mucosal barrier that confines the gut microbiota to the lumen, preventing these generally beneficial microbes from invading host tissues and triggering overt inflammation. While gut homeostasis requires this physical separation of the microbiota and host, it also depends on symbiotic interactions between them, which often occur through small molecule metabolites. For instance, by converting indigestible fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the microbiota provides colonic epithelial cells with a fuel source to power fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and energy production. Accordingly, intestinal tissues from germ-free mice show signs of energy deprivation, and the clinical significance of this metabolic integration is evident from studies correlating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with impaired FAO and changes in microbiota composition. However, the mechanisms by which these alterations could contribute to IBD remain unclear, highlighting the need to understand the pathways linking epithelial cell metabolism with microbial metabolism and whether disruptions in this symbiosis could promote inflammation. In a recent study to investigate metabolic contributions from the microbiota to the host, we performed stable isotope tracing in a mouse model and found that acetylated histones and numerous metabolites in epithelial cells contain microbiota-derived carbon. Treatment with DSS, a chemical irritant that induces inflammation, suppressed the isotopic labeling of molecules bearing fatty acid chains, coinciding with shifts in microbiota composition and decreased expression of genes related to FAO. In ongoing work, we are employing cell and organoid models to trace the anabolic and catabolic pathways by which epithelial cells metabolize microbiota-derived carbon. Overall, we aim to generate mechanistic insight into how metabolic interactions between the gut microbiota and host promote tissue homeostasis and how a disruption in this sym",

Akil and her colleagues are best known for providing the first physiological evidence for a role of endorphins in the brain and demonstrating that endorphins are activated by stress and can cause pain inhibition. Akil is a Gardner C. Quarton Distinguished Professor of Neurosciences in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School. She previously served as co-director of the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience institute and the University of Michigan node of the Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium with her husband, Stanley Watson. Akil is also one of seven leading scientists that comprise the Hope For Depression Research Task Force, whom developed a research plan that combines the currently most advanced knowledge in genetics, epigenetics, molecular biology, electrophysiology, and brain imaging in an effort to accelerate cutting-edge scientific research pertaining to depression and its related mood and emotional disorders. Throughout her career, she has been honored with numerous awards and membership to various societies, most notably she served as a past President of the Society for Neuroscience, the largest neuroscience organization in the world.

Importantly, the working group ensures that each of the BRAIN IC Advisory Councils is informed about BRAIN programs, awards, and progress \u2013 as the individual IC Advisory Councils will perform the formal concept clearance and secondary level of review of BRAIN Initiative applications.

      "description": "In 2006, Dr. Jane Sayer, an NIH research scientist in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), established the Sayer Vision Research Lecture and Award at the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), in partnership with the National Eye Institute (NEI) at NIH, to honor her family and the memory of her parents, Winthrop and Laura Sayer. The lecture and award series provides an opportunity for honorees to explore areas of interdisciplinary research that may lead to advances in diverse medical specialties with relevance to vision research. Dr. Przemyslaw (Mike) Sapieha is the Wolfe Professor in Translational Vision Research at the University of Montreal and holds the Canada Research Chair in Retinal Cell Biology. His work focuses on identifying novel, druggable mechanisms for retinal vascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Dr. Sapieha will present recent examples in which fundamental research from his lab is being translated to potential therapeutic treatments. Air date: 2/10/2026 3:00:00 PM Eastern Time",
