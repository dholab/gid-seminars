      "description": "About the event: For years, development agencies have expanded, perceived as complements to national security with support for their autonomous administration. Today, however, issues of humanitarian aid and development are seen as increasingly linked to concerns about national security and politics, while aid skepticism is growing. The fruits of this shift were made all too clear when, in July 2025, the United States under the second Donald Trump administration merged its Agency for International Development (USAID) into its Department of State, echoing a similar move unfolding in other western donor countries. The merger in the U.S. solidified a global trend following similar mergers in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand. Indeed, around the world over the past thirty years, many of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries have merged their aid and diplomacy agencies.  Although mergers are trending, are they helping countries advance their security goals? While the U.S. merger is still unfolding with many of its results yet-to-be seen, other global merger experiences offer stories that collectively indicate lessons to be learned about the rising trend to merge development and diplomacy. This presentation presents research from a review of the twenty-year history of global affairs mergers, drawing on interviews with leaders, civil servants, and activists from around the world. Considering rising Chinese development investments, ongoing fallout from COVID-19, crises in Syria, Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, climate change, and other global challenges, can development and diplomacy truly be integrated, or do these fields require distinction for their effective delivery? How might the U.S. consider the evidence from other aid-diplomacy mergers to inform its efforts to reform global affairs administration to address connected security and development challenges? This research explores the effects of recent mergers of aid and foreign policy agencies i",

      "description": "The intestinal epithelium is a critical mucosal barrier that confines the gut microbiota to the lumen, preventing these generally beneficial microbes from invading host tissues and triggering overt inflammation. While gut homeostasis requires this physical separation of the microbiota and host, it also depends on symbiotic interactions between them, which often occur through small molecule metabolites. For instance, by converting indigestible fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the microbiota provides colonic epithelial cells with a fuel source to power fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and energy production. Accordingly, intestinal tissues from germ-free mice show signs of energy deprivation, and the clinical significance of this metabolic integration is evident from studies correlating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with impaired FAO and changes in microbiota composition. However, the mechanisms by which these alterations could contribute to IBD remain unclear, highlighting the need to understand the pathways linking epithelial cell metabolism with microbial metabolism and whether disruptions in this symbiosis could promote inflammation. In a recent study to investigate metabolic contributions from the microbiota to the host, we performed stable isotope tracing in a mouse model and found that acetylated histones and numerous metabolites in epithelial cells contain microbiota-derived carbon. Treatment with DSS, a chemical irritant that induces inflammation, suppressed the isotopic labeling of molecules bearing fatty acid chains, coinciding with shifts in microbiota composition and decreased expression of genes related to FAO. In ongoing work, we are employing cell and organoid models to trace the anabolic and catabolic pathways by which epithelial cells metabolize microbiota-derived carbon. Overall, we aim to generate mechanistic insight into how metabolic interactions between the gut microbiota and host promote tissue homeostasis and how a disruption in this sym",

      "description": "This week's speakers in the Demystifying Medicine Series are John Coffin, Ph.D. (Tufts School of Medicine) and Carlos Del Rio, M.D. (Emory School of Medicine). The theme of the complementary lectures is \"The Epidemic That Won't Quit: Unraveling the HIV Crisis\". The Demystifying Medicine Series, jointly sponsored by FAES and NIH, includes presentations on pathology, diagnosis, and therapy in the context of major disease problems and current research. Primarily directed toward PhD students, clinicians and program managers, this series is designed to help bridge the gap between advances in biology and their application to major human diseases. Each session includes clinical and basic science components presented by NIH staff and invitees. All students, trainees, fellows, and staff are welcome to participate.

      "description": "Petra Kuppers will talk about her Planting Disabled Futures project, a virtual reality/community performance experience. The Planting Disabled Futures project uses live performance approaches and virtual reality technologies to share environmental connection and energy, creaturely liveliness and ongoingness, crip joy and experiences of pain.\n\nIn the development of the Virtual Reality (VR) components of the project, we asked: How can VR allow us to celebrate difference, rather than engage in hyper-mobile fantasies of overcoming and of disembodied life? How can our disabled bodymindspirits develop non-extractive intimacies, in energetic touch, using VR as a tool toward connecting with plants, with the world, even in pain, in climate emergency, in our ongoing COVID world?\nJoin Petra to find out what this experience looks and feels like, and how it both breaches and respects boundaries in an eco soma (stumbling, limping, deliciously crippy) exploratory dance.\n\nRegister to join online \n \n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nPetra Kuppers (she/her) is a disability culture activist and a community performance artist. She grounds herself in disability culture methods, and uses somatics, performance, media work, and speculative writing to engage audiences toward more socially just and enjoyable futures. Her latest academic study is the award-winning Eco Soma: Pain and Joy in Speculative Performance Encounters (Univiersity of Minnesota Press, 2022, open access). She teaches at the University of Michigan, was a 2022 Dance/USA Fellow, and a 2023 Guggenheim Fellow. She is the Artistic Director of The Olimpias, an international disability culture collective, and co-directs Turtle Disco, a somatic writing studio.\n\nLunch will begin at 11:45 a.m. for in-person attendees.",

The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus \u2014 enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF\u2019s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration. \n\nAbout the Bay Area Open Science Group\nThe Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible.",

Too much added sugar can also contribute to high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation. Ah, sugar\u2026 we know it's not good for us, but we can't seem to stop eating it! In fact, most Americans consume about 60 pounds of added sugar a year!\n\nJoin us for an interactive and practical webinar to learn the biological, psychological, and social factors that make it so hard to stop eating sugar. We will discuss the current guidelines from the American Heart Association about acceptable levels of added sugar for generally good health, expose some surprising sources of added sugar, and explore three specific strategies you can use to reduce your sugar consumption. Walk away with a better understanding of why you crave sugar and 1-2 practical ways to eat less of it.\n\nThis class will be recorded and a one-week link to the recording will be shared with all registered participants.
