# Excluded Events
# Use this file to exclude specific events from appearing on the calendar.
# Events can be excluded by exact URL match or by title pattern (regex).
#
# This works for both auto-scraped events AND manually submitted events.
# To remove an event, add its URL or a title pattern below.
